                <p>Company: Think Nature</p>
                <p>Date: October 3, 2024, 14:34</p>
                <br><br>
                
                <p>Our lives depend on various products derived from nature (commodities). Coffee beans produced in tropical regions (hereafter referred to as coffee) are one of the benefits of biodiversity.</p>

                <p>The coffee tree, which is a member of the Rubiaceae family, consists of two main species: Coffea arabica (Arabica coffee) and Coffea canephora (Robusta coffee). The cultivation of these species spans over 60 countries in tropical regions. The area dedicated to coffee cultivation exceeds 11 million hectares, supported by approximately 25 million farmers, most of whom are small-scale producers.</p>

                <p>The tropical regions suitable for coffee cultivation are biodiversity hotspots rich in wildlife species. Therefore, special consideration for biodiversity is required in the management of coffee farms.</p>

                <p>For instance, deforestation to create plantations negatively impacts the native biodiversity and ecosystem functions of the land. Large-scale natural alterations reduce wildlife habitats, diminish species richness, and degrade forest functions, such as carbon storage. This is known as the trade-off between intensive coffee harvesting and biodiversity conservation (Zewdie et al. 2022).</p>

                <p>Consequently, coffee produced in tropical forests is viewed as a "forest risk commodity" that could potentially destroy ecosystems.</p>

                <p>Therefore, companies procuring coffee must ensure the traceability of their coffee to avoid risks of deforestation related to their business activities and must grasp nature-related information from coffee farms at the very top of their supply chain.</p>

                <p>Specifically, they need to quantify "what kind of natural connections each farm has, what it depends on from nature, and what impact it has on nature" and "understand the risks related to coffee production and disclose information as necessary."</p>
                
                <br><br>
                <h3>Climate and Nature-Related Risks in Coffee Production and Procurement</h3>
                <p>Climate and nature-related risks associated with coffee production and procurement include changes in suitable coffee cultivation areas and reduced production due to climate change, as well as reduced coffee yields from pests and diseases. Coffee is sensitive to temperature and precipitation, and there are concerns about the loss of suitable cultivation areas and degradation of production due to climate change.</p>

                <p>Analysis based on climate warming scenarios reports that in the future, the suitable areas for coffee cultivation will shift significantly. The areas suitable for coffee cultivation are expected to decrease by approximately 50% globally, with the greatest impact anticipated in low-latitude, low-elevation regions (tropical lowlands) (Bunn et al. 2015).</p>

                <p>As coffee cultivation areas shift in response to climate change, pressures to develop plantations in natural forests that could serve as new cultivation locations will increase. Simultaneously, damage from the coffee borer beetle could also impact production.</p>

                <p>The development of new coffee plantations adapted to climate change (conversion from natural forests to farms) is projected to lead to a loss of carbon storage ranging from 5.9 million tons to 15.66 million tons and impact 35% of habitats for endangered vertebrate species (Magrach & Ghazoul 2015), raising concerns about further biodiversity loss and ecosystem function degradation.</p>

                <p>In light of these factors, the EU has imposed strict restrictions on the distribution of coffee derived from deforestation under the EUDR (EU Deforestation Regulation). Such environmental regulations affecting coffee distribution and the fluctuations in suitable cultivation areas and production due to climate and nature changes will complicate the sustainable supply of coffee.</p>

                <p>Moreover, coffee produced in tropical regions is among the most economically valuable commodities exported from developing countries. Millions of people are involved in the processing, roasting, and selling of coffee in the supply chain. Therefore, addressing climate and nature-related risks in coffee production and procurement at the top of the supply chain is a necessary condition for supporting the enormous coffee market.</p>
                
                <br><br>
                <h3>Toward Sustainable Coffee Production and Procurement with Climate and Nature Considerations</h3>
                <p>To mitigate or adapt to climate change while conserving and regenerating biodiversity, it is essential to strengthen the effectiveness of actions related to carbon neutrality and nature positivity. A crucial first step is to quantitatively assess the current climate and nature risks in coffee production and procurement.</p>

                <p>Information disclosure following TCFD and TNFD is not simply about "disclosing information." Likewise, responding to the EUDR should not merely involve excluding procurement from farms associated with deforestation.</p>

                <p>Climate and nature-related information disclosure for the financial sector should be aimed at transforming business practices toward carbon neutrality and nature positivity. Simultaneously, engaging with producers concerning climate and nature considerations is essential. We should enhance the sustainability of coffee production and procurement based on dialogue and collaboration with producers.</p>

                <p>In response to these challenges, Think Nature has developed the "Global Biodiversity and Nature Assessment Tool" (GBNAT), which provides nature-related data for production areas of forest-risk commodities such as coffee. GBNAT (https://gbnat.com) is a web service that supports automated reporting on biodiversity response in business.</p>

                <p>Companies involved in coffee procurement can select the location of the coffee farms they envision on the GBNAT map, choosing indicators such as the importance and integrity of biodiversity, as well as deforestation information around the farms, and generate specialized evaluation reports.</p>

                <p>When the location of a coffee farm is entered, a point is marked on the world map. Indicators such as "biodiversity importance (conservation priority indicator)" and "biodiversity integrity (natural remaining degree indicator)" for each farm are outputted, ranking and graphically displaying farms that should be focused on from the perspective of biodiversity conservation.</p>

                    <img src="coffee_2024/biodiversity-intactness.png" alt="Biodiversity Integrity Around Coffee Farms" class="content-image">
                </div>

                <p>Furthermore, data quantifying changes in forest area around each farm can be used to understand the current state of deforestation.</p>

                <p>For instance, if the forest area around a farm has significantly decreased in recent years, it indicates ongoing deforestation, suggesting that coffee produced in that region is likely derived from deforestation. Conversely, if the forest area around the farm has not decreased at all, it implies that the forest is being conserved, indicating that coffee production in that area is avoiding deforestation risks.</p>

                <p>Therefore, the graph ranked by deforestation indicators around farms can be utilized as data representing the risk of deforestation for coffee produced in each region.</p>

                </div>

                <p>Using evaluation results like those described above, it is also possible to conduct in-depth, high-resolution (20m scale) visual analyses by utilizing satellite data (services by TN LEAD).</p>

                <p>This allows quantifying both negative and positive impacts of each coffee farm's management practices (conventional farming by large-scale plantations, agroforestry, organic/reduced pesticide practices) on biodiversity and ecosystem services.</p>

                <p>Thus, we can numerically grasp the conservation and regeneration effects on biodiversity and carbon storage specific to the unique cultivation and production methods of each farm.</p>

                <p>Moreover, we can set various scenarios related to the impacts of climate change and pests on production and simulate the future risks of increases and decreases in coffee production in different scenarios, creating actionable plans for improving the supply chain to sustainably maintain coffee production and procurement based on scenario analysis.</p>
